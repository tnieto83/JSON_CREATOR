    Aim: to recognize sequences of numbers and letters.
    Range: 0-9999
Digit agrupations: units, tens, hundreds and thousands. 

    BNF Structure:
    
    $code is a rule that contains the rule $number and $alphabet to recognize infinite sequences of numbers and letters
  
        - $thousand contains whole thousands (outputs with 0) and thousands for combination with other units. The output shows a specific number for a position that is defined.
          - $hundred the same as thousands but with hundreds.
          - $ten the same as thousands but with tens.
          - $unit numbers 1 - 9 also with output to mark the position.
      - $andUnit and $andTen  contains numbers that are preceded by other digits to complete a number. The output shows a specific number for a position that is defined.
      - $alphabet contains all the letters of the alphabet.
